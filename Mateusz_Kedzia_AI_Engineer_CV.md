## üü¶ Profile

I am a graduate-level Machine Learning and Data Engineer with hands-on experience in developing and deploying scalable ML systems and robust data pipelines. During my research at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I was tasked with advancing machine learning and data engineering for IoT and geospatial data. I took the initiative to design and implement multi-user platforms, automate data collection and processing, and build custom algorithms for extracting insights from complex datasets. As a result, I enabled over 50 researchers to collaborate efficiently, improved model accuracy by up to 40%, and delivered production-ready solutions for both academic and real-world applications. I am passionate about leveraging AI and data-driven methods to solve challenging problems and am eager to contribute my expertise and teamwork skills to innovative technology teams.

## üöÄ Key Projects & Achievements

### MSc Thesis: Synthetic Spatio-temporal Car-hailing Traffic Knowledge Graphs (Ongoing)
**Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam & Beijing University of Technology**  
**Situation:** Urban mobility research requires advanced methods for modeling and classifying spatio-temporal data.  
**Task:** I am developing and benchmarking algorithms for generating large-scale spatio-temporal knowledge graphs and classifying trajectories.  
**Action:** I am designing and implementing models using GANs, LSTM-AE, and SSVM, and conducting extensive benchmarking.  
**Result:** The research is advancing the state-of-the-art in urban mobility data analysis and contributing to ongoing academic publications.  
**Reflection:** This project is deepening my expertise in spatio-temporal modeling and reinforcing my ability to tackle open-ended research problems.

### HedgeIoT: IoT Data Science Platform & ML Engineering
**Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**  
**Situation:** The university needed a scalable platform for collaborative IoT and ML research.  
**Task:** As a Research Assistant, I was responsible for designing and deploying the platform, enabling real-time data workflows.  
**Action:** I built and deployed a dockerized, multi-user JupyterHub platform for 50+ users, designed real-time data ingestion and ML pipelines, and led demo development for conferences.  
**Result:** The platform enabled efficient collaboration, real-time data analysis, and was showcased at the HedgeIoT conference, supporting 50+ researchers.  
**Reflection:** This project strengthened my skills in scalable system design, cross-team communication, and real-world ML deployment.

### Web Crawler for Dutch News Archives
**University of Amsterdam**  
**Situation:** Large-scale research required access to a comprehensive, high-integrity news dataset.  
**Task:** I was tasked with developing a robust web crawler and automating data extraction and structuring.  
**Action:** I implemented anti-blocking and relevance filtering algorithms, and automated the data pipeline to process over 1M news articles.  
**Result:** Achieved 99% data integrity and provided a reliable dataset for research.  
**Reflection:** This experience enhanced my skills in automation, data quality assurance, and large-scale data engineering.

### Bachelor's Thesis: Explainable AI for Heterogeneous IoT Data Processing
**Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**  
**Situation:** Integrating diverse IoT data sources required transparent, interoperable, and interpretable AI solutions.  
**Task:** I set out to design explainable models and data pipelines that could unify heterogeneous IoT data using linked data principles.  
**Action:** Developed and implemented ML models for forecasting device behavior, integrated data using RDF and SPARQL queries, and ensured model interpretability for end users.  
**Result:** Delivered a robust, explainable system for IoT data integration and forecasting, earning a grade of 8.0 and demonstrating the value of linked data and explainable AI in practical IoT scenarios.  
**Reflection:** This project gave me a strong foundation in semantic data integration, ML for time series forecasting, and the importance of transparency and interoperability in real-world AI systems.
